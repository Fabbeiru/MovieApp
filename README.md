# Movie app

Project to practise fetching data from API and displaying it. Search a movie by its title or imdbID and get some information about it. Check it out <a href"https://fabbeiru.github.io/MovieApp/">here</a>.

## Important!

Currently you can only search and see the result within a movie search by id. Working on displaying multiple results when searching by title.

## Improvements

- Handle more error cases found.
- Display multiple results when searching by title.
- Conditional render depending on the rating of the movie.

## Technologies

- React.js
- TypeScript
- HTML + CSS
- Responsive design
- Mobile first approach
